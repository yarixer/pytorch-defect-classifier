## Overview
This project simulates a basic visual quality inspection pipeline for pharmaceutical products.  
The model classifies an input image as:

- `good`
- `defect`

The current dataset combines two pharmaceutical object types:

- `pill`
- `capsule`

## Dataset
The dataset was built from MVTec AD categories:
- `pill`
- `capsule`

A custom supervised split was created:
- `train`
- `val`
- `test`

To reduce data leakage, visually related image groups were split together instead of using naive random file-level splitting.

## Model
- Backbone: `ResNet18`
- Framework: `PyTorch`
- Input size: `224x224`
- Loss: `CrossEntropyLoss` with class weights
- Scheduler: `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- Early stopping enabled

## Test Results
Baseline threshold:
- Accuracy: `90.16%`
- Macro F1: `89.23%`
- Defect precision: `0.93`
- Defect recall: `0.80`
- Defect F1: `0.86`

Confusion matrix:

## Threshold Tuning
A custom threshold was introduced to improve sensitivity to the `defect` class.  
Threshold tuning results are saved to:

- `artifacts/evaluation_threshold_tuning.json`
- `artifacts/confusion_matrix_threshold_tuned.png`

## API
The project includes a FastAPI inference service.

Run locally:
```bash
uvicorn src.api:app --reload

## Key Features
- Custom leakage-aware train/val/test split
- PyTorch training pipeline with class weighting
- Separate evaluation and threshold tuning
- FastAPI inference endpoint
- Dockerized deployment
- Grad-CAM visualization for model interpretability

## Limitations
- The dataset is relatively small.
- Some defects are visually subtle.
- The model still misses part of defective samples.
- This is a portfolio / educational prototype, not a production-grade pharmaceutical QA system.

## Future Work
- Improve defect recall
- Evaluate pill and capsule subsets separately
- Add ROC / PR analysis
- Improve inference-only Docker image size
- Add CI/CD for API validation
